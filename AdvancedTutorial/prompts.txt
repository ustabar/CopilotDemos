- write the python code to print the first 100 fibonacci numbers. 
  give me the actual code and not the output.

- rewrite this as a web application that takes an input from the user and 
  stored it in the variable n. n must be a number and the app will present 
  the first n fibonacci numbers to the user. write all the code in a single python file.

- create a python study plan

- Great. Rewrite the entire study plan and update it with resources and links. 
  Present the URLs in a plain format (e.g., 'https://example.com').

- Make the study plan 4 weeks. I have 10 hours every week to study.

- Act as a Berkley data science professor. 
  I have experience with multiple programming languages and have worked with tech for 10 years. 
  Rewrite the study plan to take this into account.

- Create hands-on assignments for each week that teaches me to use the techniques. 
  It should take around 5 hours to complete.

- Create a consise list of questions and answers for a Python job interview, 
  covering essential concepts and practical skills for a beginner. 
  Include explanations and coding examples where applicable.
